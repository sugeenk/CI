*****Merge and Rebase
// merge is only for local workdone. So we will merge our newbranch to our master once we are done with our work.

git checkout master
git merge mybranch

OR
// Rebase will update the master and will put mybranch on top of master in linear update
git checkout master
git rebase mybranch


*******add and commit
$git add .
$git commit -m "message"

// if files are already added to git and now we are making some changes to them then we can use combined command
$git commit -a -m "edit message and commit message"

****SSH 
//generate ssh key
$ssh-keygen
//now to see ssh key in same terminal
$cat /c/xyz/id_rsa.pub
// now copy key generated here and now navigate to GITHUB and create key here
// now authenticate ssh key
$ssh -T SSHURL


****PUSH  ( update local changes to remote server repo)
// update our local master to remote server master
$git checkout master
$git push origin master
// update our local subbranch to remote server repo by creating same branch there as well
$git checkout subbranch
$git push origin subbranch
// now we can raise a pull request and merge request
